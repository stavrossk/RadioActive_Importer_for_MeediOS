RadioActive Importer for MeediOS
================================

**Copyright (c) 2013 Skamagkis Stavros.

### Purpose

RadioActive Importer is an import plugin for MeediOS home theater application.

It scans online radio station directories and imports
the stations and their corresponding data into the MeediOS library you specify.

Currently it imports radio stations from the official IceCast directory,
but I plan to add more directories in the future, both from IceCast and ShoutCast.

Enjoy.
