RadioActive Importer for MeediOS
================================

### Purpose

RadioActive Importer scans online radio station directories and imports
the stations and their corresponding data into the MeediOS library you specify.

Currently it imports from the official IceCast directory,
but I plan to add more directories in the future, both from IceCast and ShoutCast.

Enjoy.
